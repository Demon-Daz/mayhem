<div class="about">
<p>Back in early 2012 a conversation took place at Altrincham Ice Rink, between the Manchester Phoenix 
and the Head of the British Sledge Hockey Association (B.S.H.A.) that would pave the way for a new team to form…
the Manchester Phoenix Sledge Hockey Club.

The team was to be part of the Manchester Phoenix Community Sports Foundation and aimed to start competing in the B.S.H.A. 
league in 2013, against teams from Cardiff, Hull & Peterborough. With new teams looking to start in Coventry, 
Sheffield and rumours of a team in London, these were exciting times for the sport!
With GB International Karl Nicholson being the first member of the new Manchester team,
 moving from the Kingston Kestrels, Anthony Booth and Pat Bailey coming back to the sport, 
 to start a local team, the team had a good start. With open sessions advertised through the Manchester Phoenix 
 and social media, several new players to the sport came down to try out. 
 With several people watching from the side-lines, with new players, a new coach and a new sport to many, 
 one onlooker summed up the first session perfectly...”Ive never seen so many people having so much fun,
  being so bad at something!” It was fair to say, there was a little bit of work required to get the team up to scratch.
    
During the Season, the squad had Exhibition games against the other teams, and managed to pick up a win against Peterborough, 
but more importantly, a great turnout of curious fans, looking to see what the sport was about, many left hooked!
    
With regular training sessions and support from the Manchester hockey community, 
the team really came together and progression was quicker than expected, with Netminders Steve Midghall 
getting invitedto the GB squad within 6 months!</p>
    
<p>Over the next few seasons, the Phoenix would grow and become a formidable outfit for teams,
but just couldn’t get the consistency to challenge for silverware. More people were attracted to the sport, 
including Dean Lahan & Dom Cosgrove, who would both progress in a short time to be eyed up and included in GB squads…
everything looked bright for the sport in Manchester! As many will know, the Manchester Phoenix and Altrincham Ice Rink parted 
company, and to say the fall out split Manchester hockey fans, would be an understatement. Relationships were strained between 
the two organisations who ran both sides, fans were lost to the sport and the once friendly fan atmosphere seemed to sour. 
This unfortunately effected the team and the team looked for alternative training sessions, as their current session at Widnes,
 was proving difficult to attract and retain some players, and the cost was becoming too much for the squad. 
 Despite Widnes being built with sledge hockey in mind and a great facility, 
 it was proving financially unsustainable for the team and the loss of players.
The team decided to move to Fylde, coincidentally the same facility the Manchester Phoenix were using, 
due to the cost, but the travel was too far for many and sessions weren’t as productive as they had once been,
 with lower attendances. After several sessions, the team decided to join Hull and train with them, after their invitation. 
 These several months meant the team often were not on the ice together, and things looked bleak. And then, 
 the news came that the Manchester Phoenix would cease operations in February 2017. 
 Although financially this had no impact on the club, the team seemed to be at a cross roads….with no real home rink, 
 no parent organisation and a thread bare squad….do they continue or disband? This was without doubt, 
 the darkest time in the clubs history…and potentially, the final chapter of the clubs history.</p>
  
<p>An emergency team meeting was held, with the main discussion being, does the club carry on or disband? In fairness, 
the easiest option would have been to disband, if only for a year and the players compete with other teams. Less stress, 
less hassle….but the team voted unanimously to keep going as a Manchester team. So in less than a month, 
the team had to secure ice time for training, a new name, new logo, new jerseys and ice time for games. Somehow, 
with the help of their inaugural sponsors Victory Hockey UK, it was done and the Manchester Mayhem Para Ice Hockey Club was formed!</p>
    
<p>With a few injuries sustained by players in the off season, the Mayhem loaned a few players to open the season in their first few games, 
and despite a tough season, they managed to qualify for the play offs in their first season…..which to be honest, 
felt like a championship win itself after all the issues the club had faced.
By finishing 4th in the league, the club faced the unbeaten League champions, the Kingston Kestrels!</p>
    
<p>with The Play Offs being held in Hull, the home rink of the Kestrels, many had written off the Mayhem…the Kestrels had beaten them in both league games, 
one of them quite convincingly, and with Mayhem missing one of their top defencemen in Dean Lahan, it was assumed the Kestrels would be in the final looking for the double! 
However the Mayhem came out fighting from the start and matched their opponents in every category, and lead 3-2 with a just over a minute to go. 
Then, arguably the Mayhems best player, Captain Karl Nicholson, was called for a penalty, meaning the team had to defend the last minute or so…
which they did to book their place in the Final!</p>
    
<p>The Final pitted the Mayhem against the Cardiff Huskies, who had finished 2nd in the league and again, had beaten the Mayhem. 
The mayhem received a terrible blow, their starting netminder, Steve Midghall was injured and couldn’t play in the Final. This meant back up Doug Hankinson, 
was thrust into the game, himself not feeling 100% due to possible food poisoning. It was touch and go if he would start the game, let alone finish it…however he, 
and the Mayhem, put on a master class, and won 5-0! This was the teams first ever trophy and after all that had gone on, a bit of a Cinderella story!</p>
    
<p>With momentum from that performance, the team got back to training and looked forward to the 2018 season! The Mayhem picked up another sponsor,
PLS Solicitors and also welcomed Canadian international Peggy Assinck to the squad, as she was coming to study in Scotland, and wanted to keep playing 
to keep in contention for the Canadian team, but the team also suffered a loss, as Steve Midghall decided to leave the game to concentrate on his health and coaching basketball. 
The squad still had two netminders as Darren Pomfret also joined, after trying the sport the previous year, but had taken some personal time away. 
The 2018 season was overall, a better season in terms of performances, the team finished 2nd in the League but lost narrowly in the Play Off semis, 
as the Cardiff Huskies got revenge with a 3-2 victory and went on to claim the title. The Mayhem finished third, by beating Peterborough in the 3rd/4th place game.</p>
    
<p>2019 looks to be another tough season, with all the teams improving, but with one or two new players joining the team and a new sponsor in Minuteman Press, 
as well as looking to work closer with the Manchester Storm and other local teams, the Mayhem looked to take on the League and Play Offs to get back to winning ways.
Pomfret completed his first full season, won Netminder of the league (with team mates Karl nicholson bagging forward of the year and Coach Pete hegan bagging the coach of the year awards) 
and team MVP for an impecible performance with the highest save average seen in the league, He was also selected for international duties with team GB.</p>

eventhough the current pandemic had cancelled the 20/21 season the future is still bright now that everything is opening back up<br>
